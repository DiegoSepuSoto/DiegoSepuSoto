I'm Diego Sep칰lveda 游뗿

A developer that wants to build self confidence by learning and building things.

I also have too many interests but not enough time and patience for them (a work in progress).

I'll upload some projects that will help me in the path of becoming the developer I want to be.

Some tec-stuff that I love:

- DevOps
- Web Development
- Mobile Development
- Open Source Hardware & Microcontrollers
