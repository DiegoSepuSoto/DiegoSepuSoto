## Hello There! 游녦

###### g e n e r a l &nbsp; k e n o b i &nbsp; 游디游디游디游디

I'm Diego Sep칰lveda.

A self-taught developer that, for some reason, is not proud of his college career but loves the stuff he does.

I also have too many interests but not enough time and patience for them (a work in progress).

I'll upload some projects that will help me in the path of becoming the developer I want to be.

Some technologies that I love:

- Go ;=
- NodeJS
- Flutter
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- Python
- Linux 游냖
- Open Source Hardware & Microcontrollers

##### Does that mean that I am an good on those things? Next question.

###### It's not my problem if you think that a developer should know everything or be an expert on certain technology to be respected, it is yours. We can all learn and give something to the community. 游땢

If I can give something to humanity, maybe it will be the need for self-respect and self-love for everyone.
